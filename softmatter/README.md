<h3>Soft Matter Detection</h3>

<p>Here, we define soft matter as something that an automated car would detect, and not need to stop for.  At the present moment, it is difficult for self-driving cars to discern between a hard object versus a soft object. This is important because a self-driving car needs to know when to stop like if there is a tire in the road, versus when the object is a plastic bag and the car can continue driving.</p>
