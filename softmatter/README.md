<h2> Algorithms </h2>

<p>I am starting this project for those of you out there that may have interest in learning Machine Vision, but did not attend graduate school for Computer Science.  My formal educational background is in Biophysics & Chemistry(I hold MS degrees in both), not CS.</p>

<p>The first lessons are here to demonstrate how to use Python along with OpenCV to perform feature and face detection from a live video feed on your laptop. Eventually we will teach you how to use equations from a disipline of Physics called Statistical Mechanics to detect soft matter in a live video stream, and to perform micro expression analysis.</p>

<h3>Soft Matter Detection</h3>

<p>Here, we define soft matter as something that an automated car would detect, and not need to stop for.  At the present moment, it is difficult for self-driving cars to discern between a hard object versus a soft object. This is important because a self-driving car needs to know when to stop like if there is a tire in the road, versus when the object is a plastic bag and the car can continue driving.  You'll learn more about this later.</p>
