<h2> Algo Lab </h2>

<p>
I started The AlgoLab to be a place to store projects of mine.  I love Physics and Coding, I also have expereince teaching. This project is here for those of you who did not attend grad school for Computer Science,  but are still interested in learning applied Machine Vision and Learning.
</p>

<p>
The first lessons are here to demonstrate how to use Python along with OpenCV to perform feature and face detection from a live video feed on your laptop. Eventually we will teach you how to use equations from a disipline of Physics called Statistical Mechanics to detect soft matter in a live video stream, and to perform micro expression analysis.
