<h2> Algorithms </h2>

<p>I am starting this project for those of you out there that may have interest in learning Machine Vision, but did not attend graduate school for Computer Science.  My formal educational background is in Biophysics & Chemistry(I hold MS degrees in both), not CS.</p>

<p>The first lessons are here to demonstrate how to use Python along with OpenCV to perform feature and face detection from a live video feed on your laptop. Eventually we will teach you how to use equations from a disipline of Physics called Statistical Mechanics to detect soft matter in a live video stream, and to perform micro expression analysis.</p>
