<h2> AlgoLab </h2>

<p>
AlgoLab stores my experiments on the application of the Computer Vision library OpenCV, a branch of Physics called Statistical Mechanics, on pattern detection from live video. My formal background is in Biophysics and Biochemistry, I have MS Degrees in both. You can check out my professional background <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jchiefelk">here, if you want.</a>   
</p>

<p>
The inspiration for this project came from work I did in Grad School for the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/groups/Neuroproject/index2.html"> NeuroProject </a> at UC Santa Cruz, in Sasha Sher's lab, using statistical algorithms to detect time and spatial correlations in neurons recorded by a microelectrode array.  Since that experience, I have been super into machine vision and artificial intellegence.
