<h2> AlgoLab </h2>

<p>
I started the AlgoLab as a place to store Machine Vision projects using OpenCV.  I'm not formally educated in Computer Science, my background is in Biophysics and Biochemistry, I have MS Degrees in both. You can check out my professional background <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jchiefelk">here, if you want.</a>   
</p>
<p>
The projects stored on AlgoLab are experiments on the application of a branch of Physics, called Statistical Mechanics, on pattern detection from live video.  The inspiration from this project came from the work I did in Grad School for the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/groups/Neuroproject/index2.html"> NeuroProject </a> at UC Santa Cruz, in Sasha Sher's lab, using statistical algorithms to detect time-correlations in neurons recorded by the microelectrode array.
