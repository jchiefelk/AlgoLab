<h2> Algorithms </h2>

<p>I am starting this project for those of you out there that may have interest in learning Machine Vision, but did not attend graduate school for Computer Science.  My formal educational background is in Biophysics & Chemistry, not CS, but I do know how to code.  I have acquired quite a bit of expereince with statistics and programming,  my goal is to combine the two to build software that allows robots to visualize and interpret the natural world.</p>

<p>The first lessons are here to demonstrate how to use Python along with OpenCV to perform feature and face detection from a live video feed on your laptop. Eventually we will teach you how to use equations from a disipline of Physics called Statistical Mechanics, to detect soft matter in a live video stream.</p>

<h3>Soft Matter Detection</h3>

<p>Here, we define soft matter as something that an automated car would detect, and not need to stop for.  At the present moment, it is difficult for self-driving cars to discern between a hard object versus a soft object. This is important because a self-driving car needs to know when to stop like if there is a tire in the road, versus when the object is a plastic bag and the car can continue driving</p>
