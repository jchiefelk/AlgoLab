<h2> AlgoLab </h2>

<p>
Projects in Computer Vision using C++ library OpenCV, and a branch of Physics called Statistical Mechanics on pattern detection from live video. My formal background is in Biophysics and Biochemistry, I have MS Degrees in both. You can check out my professional background <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jchiefelk">here,</a> if you want.

<p>
The motivation for this project came from work I did in Grad School for the <a href="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/groups/Neuroproject/index2.html"> Neuroproject </a> at UC Santa Cruz in 2013, in Sasha Sher's lab, using statistical algorithms to detect time and spatial correlations in neurons recorded by a microelectrode array.  Since that experience, I have been super into machine vision and artificial intellegence.
