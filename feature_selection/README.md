<h2> Feature Detection </h2>

<p>
Here we will be using Python and OpenCV to detect Points of Interest from a live video feed.  Specifically we use the SIFT algorithm to detect edges from the frames of a live video feed.  You will notice that the process is somewhat slow, and that is most likely due to the fact that we are using Python, and interpretted language.  In future sections we will use C++ to get a performance boost.
